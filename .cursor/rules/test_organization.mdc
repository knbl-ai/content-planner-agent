# Test Organization Rules

- All test files must be placed in the `/tests` directory
- Test files should be named with the pattern `test_*.py`
- Each component should have corresponding tests in a file named `test_<component_name>.py`
- Test files should include proper docstrings and clear test case descriptions
- Use descriptive test function names that explain what is being tested

When adding a new test:
1. Create it in the `/tests` directory
2. Import the module being tested
3. Define clear test functions with descriptive names
4. Include assertions that validate expected behavior

Example test structure:
```python
"""
Test module for X component.
"""
import unittest
from content_planner_agent.component import Component

def test_specific_functionality():
    """Test that specific functionality works as expected."""
    # Test setup
    component = Component()
    
    # Execute test
    result = component.function()
    
    # Assert expected results
    assert result == expected_value
```
