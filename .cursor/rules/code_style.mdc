# Code Style Guidelines

## General

- Follow PEP 8 conventions for Python code
- Maximum line length is 100 characters
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values

## Imports

- Group imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party imports
  3. Local application imports
- Separate import groups with a blank line
- Use absolute imports for clarity

## Naming Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and methods
- Use `PascalCase` for classes and types
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants

## Error Handling

- Use specific exception types instead of generic ones
- Include context information in exception messages
- Log exceptions with appropriate log levels
- Do not use bare `except:` clauses

## Comments

- Comments should explain "why" not "what"
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use TODO comments for future improvements

## State Management

- Use typing.TypedDict for state definitions
- Document state structure with clear comments
- Use Annotated types with reducers for concurrent updates

## Documentation

- Include clear docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Document parameters and return values
- Include examples where appropriate
- Keep docstrings up-to-date with implementation changes
